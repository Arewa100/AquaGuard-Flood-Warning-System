##  Overview

AquaGuard is an affordable, solar-powered flood early warning system designed for communities vulnerable to flooding. With climate change increasing flood frequency globally, vulnerable communities—especially in developing regions—lack access to early warning infrastructure. AquaGuard provides is able to critical warning at a fraction of commercial system costs.

**Built for: Tech Master Event 2025 - "Master of Survival" Contest**

## ⚠️ The Problem

### Flooding: A Growing Crisis

- **4.4 million Nigerians** displaced by floods in 2022
- **200+ deaths** in Lagos alone from flooding in 2023
- **1.47 billion people** worldwide at risk of coastal flooding
- **134% increase** in flood events since 2000

### Current Gaps

- Commercial flood sensors cost $500-2,000 (unaffordable)
- Government systems require infrastructure (often unavailable)
- Communities lack early warning (minutes vs hours)
- Water contamination after floods (disease outbreaks)

---

##  The Solution

AquaGuard provides:

1. **Early Flood Detection** - Ultrasonic water level monitoring
2. **Water Quality Testing** - Turbidity sensor for drinkability
3. **Environmental Monitoring** - Temperature and humidity tracking
4. **Independent Operation** - Solar powered, no infrastructure needed
5. **Multi-level Alerts** - Visual (LED) and audio (buzzer) warnings
6. **Extreme Durability** - Waterproof, operates 0-60°C

**Total Cost: ~$80 USD** (vs $500+ for commercial systems)

##  Key Features

###  Survival-Focused Design

- ✅ **No external power required** - Solar panel + battery backup (48+ hours)
- ✅ **No internet required** - Operates completely independently
- ✅ **Harsh condition resistant** - Waterproof (IP65+), extreme temperatures
- ✅ **Easy deployment** - Mounts on poles, walls, bridges
- ✅ **Low maintenance** - Self-powered, minimal moving parts

### 🔬 Multi-Sensor System

- **Ultrasonic Sensor** (HC-SR04) - Water level detection (5-200cm range)
- **Turbidity Sensor** - Water quality assessment
- **DHT22** - Temperature and humidity monitoring

### 🚨 Intelligent Alerts

- **Green LED** - Safe conditions
- **Yellow LED + Beeps** - Warning level (water rising)
- **Red LED + Loud Alarm** - Danger level (immediate threat)
- **OLED Display** - Real-time data display
- **Buzzer Alarm** Alert system

### 🧠 Advanced Signal Processing

- **Median filtering** - Removes outliers from turbulent water
- **Moving average** - Smooth, reliable readings
- **Stilling well** - Physical dampening of wave interference
- **Multi-threshold detection** - Customizable alert levels

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### System Architecture

i will add diagram here

### Detection Logic

1. **Ultrasonic sensor** measures distance to water surface
2. **Median filter** processes 9 readings, selects middle value
3. **Moving average** smooths readings over time
4. **Alert logic** determines threat level:
   - Distance > 100cm = **SAFE** (green)
   - Distance 50-100cm = **WARNING** (yellow)
   - Distance < 50cm = **DANGER** (red)
5. **Turbidity sensor** checks water drinkability
6. **Multi-output alerts** notify community

### Deployment Scenario

```
Normal: Device reads 250cm to water → GREEN LED
+2hrs:  Water rising, reads 180cm   → GREEN LED (monitoring)
+4hrs:  Water at 80cm               → YELLOW LED + Beeps
+6hrs:  Water at 40cm               → RED LED + Loud Alarm
Result: Community has 4-6 hours to evacuate safely
```
